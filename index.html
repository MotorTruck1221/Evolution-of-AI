       <p style="font-size: small; text-align: center;"> Preface: A.I. and robots are often scary, shown as evil overlords taking our jobs, and taking over the world. In reality A.I. are just math. However, what A.I. can do can be even more significant than them taking over the world. A.I. finds connections between objects, and can recognize connections between similar objects. When you think of A.I, you might think of a voice assistant, or an app that can identify plants. What A.I. is really used for, is much more powerful. A.I. can process massive amounts of data, finding out everything from someone with almost no information. A.I. make up autonomous weapons, which have been outlawed for being too lethal. A.I. is our future for more than the reasons you think. What A.I. is not, is sentient. A.I. can give a semblance of sentience, though it is most useful for data. An A.I. can search and interpret massive amounts of data, and give meaningful results. A bulk of the internet is run by such A.I. Consider google, which collects your actions to decide what you will like best. This can be dangerous however, such as A.I. having a programmed bias against non-white males, or directing people towards extremist groups. A.I. is a powerful tool, but one we need to control, because in the end, we made it.
